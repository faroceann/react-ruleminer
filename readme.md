ruleminer Client
==========================================

This is a React app for performing association rule discovery in the browser. It allows a user to upload a CSV file of itemsets, set minimum confidence and minimum support values and then view mined association rules from the data in a sortable table. It is intended to demo use of the ruleminer API that I developed, which uses a Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm that talks to a Node.js server. The ruleminer API project is bundled in with this project.
